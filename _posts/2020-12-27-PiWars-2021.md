title: PiWars 2021
---

It's old news by now, [Team unPi](https://www.unpi.ro/english/) got _automagically_ accepted and later confirmed for [PiWars 2021 at Home](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/) plus allowed to [represent both Romania and Finland](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/pi-wars-2021-list-of-teams/) in this [small robotics competition](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/general-rules/). Yay!

How come automagically? Due to COVID-19 the on-site [PiWars 2020 was forced](https://piwars.org/2020-competition/pi-wars-2020-postponement-due-to-coronavirus/) into being an all online, [5 minutes robot presentation](https://player.vimeo.com/video/411678839) [contest](https://piwars.org/2020-competition/virtual/results/) for all accepted teams. This break gave organizers time to brainstorm, prepare, and run an [PiWars (robotics) competition at (your) Home in 2021](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/), where each team must build at home their [competition challenges](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/challenges/), program their desired robot and submit video proofs of their own robot passing, or solving each challenge.

A bit more work for roboteers, much more challeging for organizers as in 2021 they will have [*86* competing PiWars teams to evaluate](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/pi-wars-2021-list-of-teams/). Same as in [2020, Team unPi](https://blog.unpi.ro/PiWars-2020/) is a beginner team in 2021 as well, hopefully we can take full advantage of this classification ðŸ¦¾ðŸ¤–ðŸš€
