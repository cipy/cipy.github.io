As [hinted](https://blog.unpi.ro/the-RO-bots/) at the beginning of 2020, our robo-hopes for PiWars 2021 hinge on the [Sphero's RVR design](https://robots.ieee.org/robots/rvr/).

The RVR fits neatly the [competition's size requirements](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/general-rules/), has an extendable design as pictured in our [short presentation for PiWars 2020](https://vimeo.com/411678839) and we hope to be able to equip it, program it and tune it up for each one of the [PiWars 2021 at Home challenges](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/challenges/).

Oh well, time for a small re-design.
