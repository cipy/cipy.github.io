As countries were forced to enter lockdown due to the aggresivity of the new COVID-19 virus, the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) Robotics Competition [PiWars](https://piwars.org) was forced into a virtual event for 2020, where particpant teams would submit short videos (max 6 minutes long) about their robots, their tactics and especially their progress.

We were more than happy to create our [team unPi video](https://vimeo.com/411678839) for the [virtual PiWars 2020](https://piwars.org/2020-competition/virtual/), and to spend the better half of a day watching [all 28 competing team videos](https://piwars.org/2020-competition/virtual/catchup/). The [winning teams in the virtual PiWars 2020 competition](https://piwars.org/2020-competition/virtual/results/) were decided by a group of judges, plus there was a section for the public vote too.

Thanks to a few public votes, our [team unPi](https://www.unpi.ro/english/) got place #10 in the Public Vote for Favourite Robot, definitely a good place for a beginner team who will try harder to make a splash at the PiWars 2021 edition, when it comes.
