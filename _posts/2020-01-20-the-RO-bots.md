title: the RO bots
---

After a long(er) winter break, and somewhat continuous shopping spree -- for components and especially for small robots or chassis able to compete in [PiWars](https://piwars.org) 2020, we are back blogging -- eager to show you some of our [past] contenders, and especially their pro's and con's.

While it would have been really nice for us/me[?] to 3D design and print our robot's body or chassis -- as we're qualified in the Beginner branch of PiWars -- we are under no pressure to out-compete other beginners. We're going there for the fun of it, plus as a team/family experience.

As you may imagine, over the past 3 months, our envisioned or possible robot designs, off-the-shelf options, plus their initial testing has made us change our minds about the _perfect_ [PiWars](https://piwars.org) 2020 competition robot many times over.

Here's a *very* short summary of (y)our options from 2019, as 2020 has just started.

From the cheapest, to the fastest, to the more extensible, to the most expensive.

- [CamJam EduKit #3 robot](https://thepihut.com/products/camjam-edukit-3-robotics) at Â£18 (hard carton chassis, requires some drilling)
- [STS-Pi roving robot](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/sts-pi) at Â£22.50 (its caster ball's arm looks really soft)
- [Coretec 4WD robot](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/coretec-tiny-4wd-robot-rover) at Â£54.90, plus [fastest motors](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/micro-metal-gearmotor-with-motor-shim?variant=32587883594) at Â£24 (fast as a ðŸš€)
- [Pi2Go Mk2 4WD robot](https://shop.4tronix.co.uk/products/pi2go2) at Â£83.40 (yellow TT motors capped at 240 RPM)
- [PiCar-S robot](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B06Y41JGS3/) at â‚¬90 (also based on yellow TT motors; max RPM ~240 as well)
- [Sphero RVR robot](https://www.sphero.com/rvr) at $249 (expensive, but most promising, hackable, and speedy)
- [DJI RoboMaster S1 robot](https://store.dji.com/product/robomaster-s1) at â‚¬549 (despite its price, has an immature Python SDK)

P.S. DJI's RoboMaster S1 is just FYI as it exceeds the PiWars competition max. chassis dimensions by 25mm (in length)

#### Go RO bots!
