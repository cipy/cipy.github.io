title: PiWars 2021 in June
---

Hey there, COVID-19 ðŸ˜± postponed again our [PiWars competition](https://piwars.org/2021-vpw/) to the end of June 2021.

Which gives us a bit of more time to blog, code, test and video [our RVR](https://blog.unpi.ro/the-RVR/) in action. Yay to clock resets!

In other news:
- the Raspberry Pi Foundation just launched their very first microcontroller, named [Pico Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/).
- Ciprian's [5 minutes talk about our unPi Glass](https://vimeo.com/502333479) got accepted at the [PiWars Virtual Conference 2021](https://piwars.org/2021-vc/). Yay to #unPi!
